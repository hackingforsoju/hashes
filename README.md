# Magic hashes – PHP hash "collisions"

Register with *password 1* and then sign in with *password 2*. If you're in then the storage uses specified algorithm to hash the password and PHP uses `==` to compare them (for MD5, SHA-1, and plaintext).

## [MD5](md5.md), [SHA-1](sha1.md), [SHA-224](sha224.md), [SHA-256](sha256.md)
For **MD5**, **SHA-1** and **SHA-2 family**, it uses the long-known trick (it actually is a documented feature, see [*PHP type comparison tables*](https://php.net/types.comparisons) & [*Floating point numbers*](https://php.net/types.float)) that for PHP `'0e1' == '00e2' == '0'`, it just uses it for *practical* purposes. Any password *matches* any other password from the list. This is a different trick than *integral strings overflowing into floating point numbers*, just spot the difference between [these two lines](https://3v4l.org/581R5).

## [Plaintext](plaintext.md)
For **plaintext**, it uses various conversion tricks. First password will *match* just the second one. Tricks are grouped by PHP versions allowing them.

## [bcrypt](bcrypt.md)
**bcrypt** truncates passwords to a maximum length of 72 characters. The passwords *match* if the first 72 characters of both passwords match.

## [PBKDF2](pbkdf2.md)
If you use a password longer than 64 bytes and hash it with **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1**, it is first *pre-hashed* with SHA1, so `PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1(password1) === PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1(password2)` because `sha1(password1) === bin2hex(password2)`.

## [Tiger/192,3](tiger192,3.md)
Right now there's just one magic hash in each thanks to [Norbert Tihanyi](https://twitter.com/TihanyiNorbert), more will be hopefully added in the future.

### Conclusion
Use `===` when comparing anything* in PHP, not `==`. And use [`password_hash()`](https://php.net/function.password-hash) and [`password_verify()`](https://php.net/function.password-verify) for password hashing in PHP, don't use MD5 or SHA-1. *Use [`hash_equals()`](https://php.net/function.hash-equals) when comparing hashes.

### History
It all started with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/spazef0rze/status/439352552443084800), I've generated `QNKCDZO` and `240610708` in February 2014 and it has since spread all over the intertubes. Just [google it](https://www.google.cz/search?q=%22QNKCDZO%22).

### How to calculate your own
I've used my laptop, few `for` (or `foreach`?) loops, many CPU cycles and [an external fan](https://twitter.com/spazef0rze/status/1150086642113437697) back in 2014 but today you can/should use a GPU and a modified hashcat for that. See [this write-up](https://grocid.net/2019/08/03/finding-magic-hashes-with-hashcat/) by [Carl Löndahl](https://twitter.com/carllondahl) and [0xb0bb](https://twitter.com/0xb0bb).

Chick3nman & co. is also [working](https://twitter.com/Chick3nman512/status/1157748868823621638) on their version of hashcat, stay tuned.
